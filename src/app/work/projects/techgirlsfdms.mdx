There's a special kind of chaos that happens when you're building a prototype. It's the smell of hot glue guns, the sound of servos whining, and the silent scream of your Arduino Uno as it struggles to interpret the nonsense your sensors are feeding it. This was my summer at TechGirls: building a miniature flood detection system with nothing but stubborn hardware, international teamwork, and a truly alarming amount of cardboard.

## The Grand Plan (And Where It Went Wrong)

The idea was simple:

- Use an Arduino Uno to monitor environmental sensors
- Deploy an ELEGOO Mega 2560 to control a bridge-lifting mechanism
- Detect floods before they happened

The reality was less straightforward.

Our sensor lineup included:

- **The YL-69 Soil Moisture Sensor**, which interpreted morning dew as biblical floods
- **The HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**, which refused to acknowledge water unless it was at least ankle-deep
- **The DHT22**, the only component that worked reliably (which felt suspicious)

I quickly learned that "plug-and-play" is a myth. Every sensor needed coaxing, recalibrating, or outright begging.

## Cardboard: The Ultimate Test of Hubris

The bridge itself was a masterpiece of questionable engineering:

- Constructed from corrugated cardboard (load rating: one AA battery)
- Reinforced with popsicle sticks and hope
- Powered by a SG90 servo that had the torque of a tired butterfly

We learned three things fast:

1. Cardboard warps when you look at it wrong
2. Hot glue burns are inevitable
3. No amount of PID tuning can compensate for structural instability

After three iterations (and one minor servo fire), we had something that vaguely resembled a flood-responsive bridge. It lifted. Sometimes. When the humidity was just right.

## The Sensor Rebellion

Getting the components to cooperate felt like herding cats:

- The YL-69 needed manual recalibration every 12 hours
- The HC-SR04 required a tilt switch backup after it ignored critical water levels
- The ELEGOO Mega kept browning out until we pillaged capacitors from another project

At one point, I found myself whispering to a soil moisture sensor like it was a disgruntled employee. It didn't help.

## Lessons Learned (The Hard Way)

### Prototypes exist to humble you
If your first iteration works perfectly, you're either lying or about to be very disappointed.

### Hardware has personality
Some sensors are divas. Some are slackers. The good ones are probably broken.

### Cardboard doesn't care about your GPA
It will fail, and it will fail spectacularly. This is the way.

## The Grand Finale

Demo day arrived. The system:

- Detected water most of the time
- Lifted the bridge enough to count
- Didn't catch fire during the presentation

Was it perfect? No.  
Did it prove the concept? Barely.  
Would I do it again? Absolutely.

Because that's the point of prototypesâ€”to turn "this might work" into "this could work," one cardboard bridge at a time.
