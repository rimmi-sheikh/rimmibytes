You know you’re deep in a tech exchange program when you find yourself in a Virginia Tech lab, surrounded by wires, sensors, cardboard, and three teammates from different countries—all trying to build something that won’t catch fire or fall apart mid-demo. Welcome to the TechGirls Capstone Project™.

While most people go souvenir shopping, I spent my summer building a flood detection system with some of the coolest girls from Morocco and Costa Rica. Because who needs rest when you’ve got a mission to save the world (or at least, build a working prototype that looks like it could)?

## Starting Point: ‘It’s Just Sensors, How Hard Can It Be?’

At first, everything sounded pretty straightforward: find the right sensors, write the code, and voila, flood-detecting magic. But oh, how little I knew.

The team gave me a rough layout of what we needed, and by "rough," I mean it was more of a collection of “ideas” and “here’s the stuff we need to detect,” not so much a detailed blueprint. The idea was solid, but the execution? Not so much.

I thought, “I’ve got this.” Then reality hit. I realized I was now responsible for making these sensors actually *talk* to each other, while also making sure the system didn't randomly flood my garage (or worse, send me a false alarm).

## The Setup: Sensors and More Sensors... Everywhere

We weren’t just using one sensor. Oh no, we had the *whole* ensemble. There were river water detectors, humidity sensors, temperature sensors—you name it. It was like setting up a tiny, techie army that was supposed to predict floods before they happened.

It didn’t help that some of these sensors didn’t like to cooperate. Imagine a toddler with a tantrum. That was my *RiverWatch Alert* sensor for a good couple of days. I’d plug it in, and nothing. Absolutely nothing. But, because I’m a patient person (and by patient, I mean I was about to throw it across the room), I tried again.

After several coffee-fueled nights, I finally got the thing working, only for the *RainPredict Sensor* to start playing hard to get. This was basically a game of sensor whack-a-mole.

## The BridgeSafe Lifter: My Favorite Drama Queen

At the heart of it all was the *BridgeSafe Lifter*, which was a very high-maintenance component. It’s supposed to lift the bridge if the water level rises—think of it like a really fancy elevator for bridges. But getting it to *actually* raise when the water was just right? Not as simple as it sounds.

Here’s where things got really *DIY*. We had to craft a small model of the bridge using cardboard, corks, and sticks—because, well, the materials weren’t exactly in a fancy design shop. With a few cuts here and there, some superglue (and way too many cardboard burns), we had ourselves a “bridge.” It wasn’t perfect, but it was a *bridge*, and I was proud of it.

After a few design iterations (and a fair amount of panic), I got the servos working to raise the bridge automatically. Every time it went up, I pretended to be more graceful than I actually was, as if I *meant* to make this thing happen in two days instead of two weeks.

## Key Lessons (Other Than That I Need More Patience):

- **Test everything**: Don’t just assume everything is fine until it’s not. Start small, test components, and don’t declare things “dead” too soon. (Looking at you, *RiverWatch Alert* sensor.)
- **Patience is key**: You’ll spend a lot of time talking to your sensors like they’re stubborn toddlers. But eventually, they’ll listen.
- **Turn it off, turn it on again**: This doesn’t just work for your Wi-Fi router. It also works on sensors, servos, and—surprisingly—me after a very bad coding session.

## Final Result: A Flood Detection System That *Actually Works* (Mostly)

We pulled it off. The FDMS wasn’t just a pile of wires and false alarms. It worked. The RiverWatch Alert sounded when it needed to, the RainPredict Sensor did its job, and the BridgeSafe Lifter rose to the occasion (literally). And the cardboard bridge? Well, it did its job too—stayed up just long enough to prove the concept.

Was it flawless? No. Was it better than watching a flood take over? Absolutely. And you know what? The best part was seeing a concept come to life and actually *knowing* that it could help people in flood-prone areas.

So yeah, I didn’t plan on becoming a flood-detection expert in high school, but here we are.
