        I'm Rimmal—A Level student, tech tinkerer, and frequent victim of my own ideas. Based in

        3D model concepts no one asked for, and negotiate with circuits like they owe me money. 
        If it involves code, design, or an unnecessary amount of overcomplication, I’m probably in. 
        Welcome to my portfolio—try not to trip over the unfinished projects.
