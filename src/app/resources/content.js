      Rimmal is an engineering enthusiast with a passion for electrical systems, environmental technology, 
      and a surprising fondness for spaghetti bridges. She merges hardware, AI, and sustainability to create 
      impactful solutionsâ€”from air quality monitoring to flood detection systems. Whether sheâ€™s debugging code 
      or building a car chassis from scratch, Rimmalâ€™s work bridges the gap between practicality and ingenuityâ€”
      sometimes literally.
