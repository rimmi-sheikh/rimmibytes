## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m a passionate tech enthusiast with a strong background in engineering, AI, and innovation. My journey in STEM has been driven by curiosity and a desire to create impactful solutions that bridge technology with real-world applications. From working on AI-powered projects to developing Arduino-based prototypes, I love exploring the intersection of creativity and technology.

## My Journey in STEM

My fascination with technology started early, but it truly took shape through hands-on experiences and collaborative projects. As a TechGirls alumna, I had the opportunity to work on a Flood Detection and Mitigation System with international teammates, leveraging engineering and technology to address real-world challenges. Additionally, my research on AQI prediction using machine learning has deepened my interest in how AI can be used for environmental sustainability.

## Areas of Interest

Iâ€™m particularly interested in AI, cybersecurity, and embedded systems. My work has spanned from machine learning research to designing automation systems using Arduino. The ethical implications of AI also intrigue me, which led me to co-author a paper on responsible AI development. Additionally, I enjoy tackling cybersecurity challenges, exploring how AI can be used to detect and prevent digital threats.

## Community and Leadership

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m committed to empowering others through education and outreach. I founded â€˜Learn. Tinker. Innovate.â€™ to introduce young girls to STEM through hands-on workshops, and I actively participate in mentorship programs. Leadership roles in school and competitions have honed my ability to collaborate, organize, and inspire others to innovate.

## Looking Ahead

My goal is to continue exploring cutting-edge technology while making meaningful contributions to the STEM community. Whether through research, product development, or mentorship, I strive to push boundaries and create solutions that have a lasting impact. Excited for what the future holds! ðŸš€
